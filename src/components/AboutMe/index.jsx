        <p>
          Thank you for taking the time to look at this webpage.<br />
          I have been studying Web Development at the Skills Bootcamp (edX / Skills for Life).<br />
          During  the course I have created a series of websites and terminal applications.<br />
          As I progressed through the course, the complexity and sophistication of the websites increased.<br />
          You can monitor my personal progress by visting the sites and running the applications.<br />
          <br />
          Kind Regards<br />
          Steve<br />
