        <p>
          Thanks for taking the time to look at this webpage.<br />
          I am currently studying Web Development at the Skills Bootcamp (edX / Skills for Life).<br />
          Over the coming weeks I will be creating a series of websites and adding links to them here.<br />
          As I progress through the course, the complexity and sophistication of the websites will increase.<br />
          You can monitor my personal progress by visting the sites.<br />
          <br />
          Kind Regards<br />
          Steve<br />
